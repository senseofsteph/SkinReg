## Hackbright Academy Prep Project

### Overview

A terminal based game that helps a user create a skincare regimen

### Technologies required

Replit.com - a collaborative browser based intergrated development environment

### Data

- User first name, skincare texture, and skincare type
- Information on skincare products and the range of skin types and textures

### Roadmap

#### MVP

- User selects skin care texture and type (oily, normal, acne-prone, or sensitive)
- User selects skin care products that match their skin type

#### 2.0

- User has more routine application steps (e.g., toner, serum, moisturizer, night cream, eye cream, sunscreen)
- Ascii art for creative visualization

#### Instructions

The game is self explanatory and simple. Read the prompts, type in your response, and once you're ready for the next step, press enter.

### Notes

- SkinReg is my first terminal-based project, created during my Hackbright Academy prep course. I hope you enjoy the interaction as much as I do! :)
